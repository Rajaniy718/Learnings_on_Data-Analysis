    # Share Data Through the Art of Visualisation

        - Effective Data Visualisation:
        
             1. Review two frameworks that are useful for thinking about how to organize the information in your visualization.
             2. Explore pre-attentive attributes and how they can be used to affect the way people think about your visualizations.
             3. Quick review of the design principles that should keep in mind when creating your visualization. 
             
        - Frameworks for organizing thoughts:
             
             1. The McCandless Method : 
                 a. Information: the data you are working with
                 b. Story: a clear and compelling narrative or concept
                 c. Goal: a specific objective or function for the visual
                 d. Visual form: an effective use of metaphor or visual expression
                 
             2. Kaiser Fungâ€™s Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup :
                 a. What is the practical question? 
                 b. What does the data say?
                 c. What does the visual say? 

        - Pre-attentive attributes are the elements of a data visualization that people recognize automatically without conscious effort. 
          The essential, basic building blocks that make visuals immediately understandable are called marks and channels.
